          Imlygic is an oncolytic immunotherapy indicated for the treatment of melanoma that is regionally or distantly metastatic
        <p>
        <p><span class="heading">Important Safety Information</span></p>
        <span class="bold">Immunocompromised Patients</span>: Imlygic has not been studied in immunocompromised patients.  Based on animal data, patients who are severely immunocompromised may be at an increased risk of disseminated herpetic infection and should not be treated with Imlygic.  Disseminated herpetic infection may also occur in immunocompromised patients (such as those with HIV/AIDS, leukemia, lymphoma, common variable immunodeficiency, or who require chronic high-dose steroids or other immunosuppressive agents).  Consider the risks and benefits of treatment before administering Imlygic to these patients.
        <p> <span class="bold">Accidental Exposure to Imlygic:</span> Accidental exposure may lead to transmission of Imlygic and herpetic infection. Healthcare providers and close contacts (household members, caregivers, sex partners, or persons sharing the same bed) should avoid direct contact with injected lesions or body fluids of treated patients. Accidental needle stick and splash back have been reported in healthcare providers during preparation and administration of Imlygic.</p>
        <p>Patients should be advised to avoid touching or scratching injection sites as this could lead to inadvertent transfer of Imlygic to other areas of their body.</p>
        <p>Close contacts who are pregnant or immunocompromised should not change the patient’s dressings or clean their injection sites.</p>
        <p>Caregivers should be advised to wear protective gloves when assisting patients in applying or changing occlusive dressings and to observe safety precautions for disposal of used dressings and cleaning materials.</p>
        <p>In the event of an accidental exposure to Imlygic, exposed individuals should be advised to clean affected area thoroughly with soap and water and/or a disinfectant.  If signs or symptoms of herpetic infection develop, they should contact their healthcare provider.  Imlygic is sensitive to acyclovir.</p>
        <p><span class="bold"> Herpetic Infection in Imlygic-treated Patients:</span> In clinical studies, herpetic infections (including cold sores and herpes keratitis) have been reported in patients treated with Imlygic.  Patients who develop herpetic infections should be advised to follow standard hygienic practices to prevent viral transmission.</p>
        <p>Imlygic is sensitive to acyclovir.  Consider the risks and benefits of Imlygic treatment before administering acyclovir or other anti-viral agents as these agents may interfere with the effectiveness of Imlygic.</p>
        <p> <span class="bold">Cellulitis at the Injection Site:</span> Necrosis or ulceration of tumor tissue may occur during Imlygic treatment.  Cellulitis and systemic bacterial infection have been reported.  Careful wound care and infection precautions are recommended, particularly if tissue necrosis results in open wounds.</p>
        <p> <span class="bold">Impaired healing at the Injection Site:</span> In clinical studies, impaired healing at the injection site has been reported.  Imlygic may increase the risk of impaired healing in patients with underlying risk factors (e.g., previous radiation at the injection site or lesions in poorly vascularized areas).</p>
        <p>Consider the risks and benefits of Imlygic before continuing treatment if persistent infection or delayed healing develops.</p>
        <p> <span class="bold">Immune-mediated Events:</span> In clinical studies, immune-mediated events including glomerulonephritis, vasculitis, pneumonitis, and worsening psoriasis have been reported in patients treated with Imlygic.</p>
        <p>Consider the risks and benefits of Imlygic before initiating treatment in patients who have underlying autoimmune disease or before continuing treatment in patients who develop immune-mediated events.</p>
        <p> <span class="bold">Plasmacytoma at Injection Site:</span> Plasmacytoma has been reported in proximity to the injection site after administration of Imlygic. Consider the potential risks and benefits of Imlygic in patients with multiple myeloma or in whom plasmacytoma develops during treatment.</p>
        <p> <span class="bold">Adverse Reactions:</span> The most commonly reported adverse drug reactions (≥ 25%) in Imlygic-treated patients were fatigue, chills, pyrexia, nausea, influenza like illness, and injection site pain. Most adverse reactions reported were mild or moderate in severity and generally resolved within 72 hours.  The most common grade 3 or higher adverse reaction was cellulitis.</p>
